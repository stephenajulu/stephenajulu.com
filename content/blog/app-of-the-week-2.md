Here's the app of the week #2

## [Simplenote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.automattic.simplenote)

This is a "minimal but gets the job done" note taking app.

It was built by Automattic.

**Pros**

1. Minimal Interface
2. Supports markdown
3. Supports exports and backing up
4. Is cross platform, so you can sync your notes from Android to windows or Mac

**Cons**

1. Doesn't support reminders

And that's it for now, share, subscribe and comment.
