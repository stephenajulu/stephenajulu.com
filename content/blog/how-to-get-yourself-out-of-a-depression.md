1. Talk to someone - it is said that a problem shared is a, problem half solved
2. Workout/Exercise - Exercise has been proven to help bring people out of depression because it increases serotonin among other "feel good" hormones. 
3. Engage in a hobby - Similar to exercise, this will help raise feel good hormones
4. Let it out - If you have been carrying a heavy burden then just find a place where you are alone and let it all out. 
5. Find a solution - i know how this sounds but if there's a problem then I'd like to believe that there's a solution. 
6. Go to Christ - He knows all your problems, take it to the Lord in prayer. 
7. Distract yourself - if all else fails then distract yourself productively.
