Do you want to invest in cryptocurrencies? Well here's how you can buy your first cryptocurrency as a beginner.

1. Register in a Cryptocurrency Exchange. There's Binance, Coinbase, and [more](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjtuIzQ8r_0AhU8SfEDHZCwAo8QFnoECAQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcoinmarketcap.com%2Frankings%2Fexchanges%2F&usg=AOvVaw0XciKeBh46uGvvqu9SLfkT). I suggest Binance. So if you'd like to register. here's the link: [Register on Binance Today!](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=CL2JFAB6)

   You'll be required to submit proof of identification.
2. Set up how you will buy them e.g card, bank, or mpesa
3. Go buy your first crypto. I suggest Ethereum or Bitcoin

Simple as that!
