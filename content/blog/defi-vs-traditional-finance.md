One of the best ways to see the potential of DeFi is to understand the problems that exist today.

* Some people aren't granted access to set up a bank account or use financial services.
* Lack of access to financial services can prevent people from being employable.
* Financial services can block you from getting paid.
* A hidden charge of financial services is your personal data.
* Governments and centralized institutions can close down markets at will.
* Trading hours often limited to business hours of specific time zone.
* Money transfers can take days due to internal human processes.
* There's a premium to financial services because intermediary institutions need their cut.

### A comparison

| DeFi | Traditional finance |
| --- | --- |
| You hold your money. | Your money is held by companies. |
| You control where your money goes and how it's spent. | You have to trust companies not to mismanage your money, like lend to risky borrowers. |
| Transfers of funds happen in minutes. | Payments can take days due to manual processes. |
| Transaction activity is pseudonymous. | Financial activity is tightly coupled with your identity. |
| DeFi is open to anyone. | You must apply to use financial services. |
| The markets are always open. | Markets close because employees need breaks. |
| It's built on transparency â€“ anyone can look at a product's data and inspect how the system works. | Financial institutions are closed books: you can't ask to see their loan history, a record of their managed assets, and so on. |
