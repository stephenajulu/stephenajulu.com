## Digital Trust

[Blockchain](https://bernardmarr.com/blockchain-distributed-ledgers/ "https://bernardmarr.com/blockchain-distributed-ledgers/") technology, distributed ledgers, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are transforming our world, and we will continue to see advances in this technology in 2022. These innovations go beyond Bitcoin to things like smart contracts that allow us to verify ownership with [NFTs](https://bernardmarr.com/the-10-best-examples-of-nfts/ "https://bernardmarr.com/the-10-best-examples-of-nfts/"). This year, we will see more companies and individuals enhancing physical objects with blockchain technology and tokens.

## 3D Printing

We can now make things with [3D printing](https://bernardmarr.com/top-6-most-amazing-ways-3d-printing-is-now-used-in-practice/ "https://bernardmarr.com/top-6-most-amazing-ways-3d-printing-is-now-used-in-practice/") that we would never have dreamed of a decade ago. In 2022, we’ll see transformations in manufacturing and beyond, from 3D printing technological innovations, including mass-produced customized pieces, concrete for houses, printed food, metal, and composite materials.

## Genomics

The 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to two scientists, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna, for their work developing a method for genome editing. Genomics, gene editing, and synthetic biology are a top trend of 2022 because these advancements can help us modify crops, cure and eradicate diseases, and develop new vaccines like the COVID-19 shot, and other medical and biological breakthroughs.

Nanotechnology will also allow us to give materials new attributes by manipulating them on a subatomic level, so we can create things like bendable screens, better batteries, water-repellent, self-cleaning fabrics, and even self-repairing paint this year.

## Datafication

Data is a key enabler for all of these trends. All of the digitization in our world today means we have enormous amounts of data available, and data has now become the number one business asset for every organization. We can use data to better understand our customers, research key trends, and get insight into what’s working inside our organizations.

## Data Fabric

[Data fabric](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-fabric-architecture-is-key-to-modernizing-data-management-and-integration) provides flexible, resilient integration of data sources across platforms and business users, making data available everywhere it’s needed regardless of where the data lives.

Data fabric can use analytics to learn and actively recommend where data should be used and changed. This can reduce data management efforts by up to 70%.

## Cybersecurity Mesh

[Cybersecurity mesh](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/the-top-8-cybersecurity-predictions-for-2021-2022) is a flexible, composable architecture that integrates widely distributed and disparate security services.

Cybersecurity mesh enables best-of-breed, stand-alone security solutions to work together to improve overall security while moving control points closer to the assets they’re designed to protect. It can quickly and reliably verify identity, context, and policy adherence across cloud and non-cloud environments.

## Decision Intelligence

[Decision intelligence](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-make-better-business-decisions) is a practical approach to improving organizational decision-making. It models each decision as a set of processes, using intelligence and analytics to inform, learn from and refine decisions.

Decision intelligence can support and enhance human decision-making and, potentially, automate it through the use of augmented analytics, simulations, and AI.

## Hyperautomation

[Hyperautomation](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/hyperautomation) is a disciplined, business-driven approach to rapidly identify, vet, and automate as many business and IT processes as possible.

Hyperautomation enables scalability, remote operation, and business model disruption.
