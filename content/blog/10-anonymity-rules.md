 4. Use Burner Emails.
 5. Use a VPN (A Non Logging and Non 14 Eyes Virtual Private Network).
 6. Don’t Log In Unnecessarily.
 7. Use Private Browsing Modes.
 8. Use Duck Duck Go (Secure Search Engine with a Strict No Following Rule).
 9. Disable Telemetry Everywhere When Possible.
10. Pair a VPN with something else, because VPNs don’t make you anonymous.
