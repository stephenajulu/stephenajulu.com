Smart contracts have been hailed as a game-changer in the world of business, enabling efficient and secure transactions across a wide range of industries. From supply chain management to healthcare, the use cases for smart contracts are vast and varied. In this article, we will explore the potential of smart contracts and how they are being used to streamline processes, increase transparency, and reduce costs across a variety of industries.

Now, what are smart contracts? 

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist over a decentralized network and exist as a shared digital infrastructure, enforced by the network of computers that run the blockchain.

An example of a smart contract could be a simple agreement between two parties to buy and sell a piece of property. The contract could be set up with the following terms:

* The buyer will transfer X amount of cryptocurrency to the seller's digital wallet
* The seller will transfer the title of the property to the buyer
* The transaction will only be completed and the cryptocurrency will be released to the seller once the title has been verified by a neutral third party and transferred to the buyer's name.

Once the terms are coded in, the smart contract would exist on the blockchain, and it would be executed automatically when the conditions are met. In this case, the buyer transferred the cryptocurrency, the title of the property was transferred to the buyer, and a neutral third party verified the transfer, the smart contract would automatically release the cryptocurrency to the seller's digital wallet. This process is secure, and transparent and eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing the risk of fraud and increasing the efficiency of the transaction.

Here's an example of a smart contract for the above written in solidity, one of the programming languages smart contracts can be written in. 

    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    
    contract PropertySale {
        address payable public seller;
        address payable public buyer;
        uint256 public price;
        string public propertyTitle;
        bool public isVerified;
        bool public isComplete;
    
        constructor(address payable _seller, address payable _buyer, uint256 _price, string memory _propertyTitle) public {
            seller = _seller;
            buyer = _buyer;
            price = _price;
            propertyTitle = _propertyTitle;
            isComplete = false;
            isVerified = false;
        }
    
        event LogPurchase(address indexed buyer, address indexed seller, uint256 price);
    
        function verifyTitle() public {
            require(msg.sender == seller);
            isVerified = true;
        }
    
        function complete() public {
            require(isVerified);
            require(msg.sender == buyer);
            require(msg.value == price);
            seller.transfer(price);
            isComplete = true;
            emit LogPurchase(buyer, seller, price);
        }
    }

## Supply Chain Management 

One of the most promising use cases for smart contracts is in supply chain management. Smart contracts can be used to automate the tracking of goods and materials as they move through the supply chain. For example, a smart contract can be set up to automatically release payment to a supplier once a shipment of goods has been verified as delivered. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud and increase transparency in the supply chain.

**Example:** Walmart has partnered with IBM to use smart contracts to improve traceability in its food supply chain. The system tracks food from farm to store using RFID technology, and smart contracts are used to automatically verify that products have been handled properly and are safe for consumption.

## Real Estate

Another area where smart contracts are being used is in the real estate industry. Smart contracts can be used to automate the buying and selling of property, as well as the management of rental agreements. For example, a smart contract can be set up to automatically release payment to a landlord once a tenant has been verified as having moved into a rental property. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud and increase transparency in the real estate market.

**Example:** The city of South Burlington, Vermont, USA is using smart contracts to automate the property transfer process and eliminate the need for intermediaries. This not only speeds up the process but also saves on costs.

## Healthcare

Smart contracts are also being used in the healthcare industry to improve patient care and streamline administrative processes. For example, a smart contract can be used to automatically release medical records to a healthcare provider once a patient has been verified as having given their consent. This can help to increase patient privacy and security. Smart contracts can also be used to automate the tracking of medical equipment and supplies, helping to ensure that the right equipment is in the right place at the right time.

**Example:** The Medicalchain is using smart contracts to securely store and share patient data across different healthcare providers, with the patientâ€™s consent. This allows for a more coordinated and efficient approach to patient care.

## Banking and Finance

Smart contracts are being used in the banking and finance industry to automate financial transactions and reduce the need for intermediaries. For example, a smart contract can be set up to automatically release payment to a borrower once a loan has been verified as being repaid. This can help to reduce the risk of fraud and increase transparency in the financial market.

**Example:** The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has announced it will replace its current clearing and settlement system with a blockchain-based platform that uses smart contracts to automate the process. This can reduce the settlement time and save on costs.

## Insurance

Smart contracts are also being used in the insurance industry to automate the claims process and reduce the need for intermediaries. For example, a smart contract can be set up to automatically release payment to policyholders once a claim has been verified as being valid. This can help to increase efficiency and reduce the risk of fraud in the insurance industry.

**Example:** The startup firm Aigang Network is using smart contracts to automate the process of buying, managing, and claiming insurance for IoT devices. This allows for a more efficient and transparent process for both the policyholder and the insurer.

## Voting

Smart contracts can be used in voting systems to increase transparency and reduce the risk of fraud. For example, a smart contract can be set up to automatically verify voter identities and ensure that each voter can only vote once. This can help to increase the integrity of the voting process.

**Example:** The West Virginia Secretary of State's office developed a mobile voting platform that uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to enable military personnel to vote securely via a mobile app during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. This allows for a more accessible and secure voting process.

## Energy and Utilities

Smart contracts can be used in the energy and utilities industry to automate the management and distribution of energy resources. For example, a smart contract can be set up to automatically release payment to a renewable energy producer once their energy has been verified as being delivered to the grid. This can help to increase the efficiency and transparency of the energy market.

**Example:** LO3 Energy is using smart contracts to enable the trading of locally produced solar energy within neighborhoods. This allows for a more decentralized and efficient energy market, where energy producers and consumers can directly transact with each other. The platform also uses smart meters to track energy usage and automatically execute the smart contract for energy transactions.

### Conclusion

Smart contracts have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, from supply chain management to healthcare. By automating processes and increasing transparency, smart contracts can help to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and increase security. As the technology behind smart contracts continues to evolve, we can expect to see more and more innovative use cases emerge in the coming years.
