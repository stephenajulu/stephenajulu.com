Hi everyone, welcome back. Today, I'll be talking about the importance of having at least 2 different types of eyewear.

So let's dive in!

The first kind of eyewear you need is obvious.

### 1. Sunglassess

Sun glasses not only protect you from the visible light but also from invisible light know as ultraviolet light. This kind of light is emitted by the sun and on sunny days can cause degeneration and strain. Remember these light also reflect on water so not only are sunglasses going to protect you from ultraviolet rays from the sun but also reflected UV. Aside from this, sunglasses can reduce light input helping you function where light is focused on you.

Let's not forget their usefulness when you have a pink, black eye, eye bags and other eye issues(Fighting is greatly discouraged here, solve things like grown up adults).

It can also prevent [**Photokeratitis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photokeratitis)**.**

Make sure not to go too much into the dark side üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è because that can cause your pupils to expand in order to help you see better therefore allowing more light and you know why that's wrong right? UV rays!

They also make you look cool and hot(contradictory huh).

Also remember eyelid skin is one of the thinnest, so putting on some shades may prevent darkening and damage.

##### Things to look for when shopping or looking for sunglasses

* 90 percent and above UV protection(Very Important).
* A wraparound style.
* Polarization(Optional. Reduces Glare).
* Tinting(Purely Cosmetic. Choose one you like).

Now note UV is not bad, it's the amount you get that should be reduce. Your body requires this. So just remember too much of something is the issue. The same can be said about the next one Blue Light.

### 2. Geek/Computer Glasses(aka Blue light Clear Glasses)

If you are like me, spending a lot of time in front of a computer screen then you need this. These protect your eyes from bluelight released by our devices. This means, laptops, phones, computer monitors, smart watches and such.

Blue light is harmful because it causes ocular degeneration and it's everywhere, i just mentioned a few, there's the sun, fluorescent and LED light bulbs.

Blue light also causes eye strain and disruptive sleep and circadian rhythms.

Look for one that promises 40% and above.
