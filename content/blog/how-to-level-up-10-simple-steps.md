## 1. Read 10 pages a day

Dedicate 1 hour a day to learning deliberately this can be through reading any book(better with Self-help and self-development) even the Bible. I will soon post books you can read in a separate post. Learn more about the 5-hour rule.

## 2. Balance out the negative talk with positive talk and vice versa

They say too much of something is poisonous and this is very true even in positive mental talk. If you are positive all the time, life will hit you like a fast-moving truck on a highway. Balance it out. Identify the things you are bad at, bad things you have done and fix them, try adding positive self-talk of actual good things you've done. Mental health should be a priority, don't just dwell on the negative, everyone on this planet has a good side. Try balancing, this way you can solve personal problems within yourself and help yourself realize your attractive traits.

## 3. Make your bed

Someone once said, "If you want to change the world, make your bed". Small steps lead to big results. This may seem small and annoying but it actually builds your day into a successful one.

## 4. Take responsibility for your life

This is a no-brainer. No one is to blame for the challenges you are facing. You are! Move away, Fix, and Avoid things you know have dire consequences.

## 5. Build your online presence

First, start with changing all your profiles so as to have matching names. Many people underestimate the importance of consistency online. Few have reaped the benefits of showing your real name and posting meaningful posts.

## 6. Work out

You need to understand the importance of having a good and flexible body. It transcends physical benefits. Your mind gets clearer. Your body feels lighter and better. It boosts your immune system and so much more.

## 7. Adopt a healthier diet

My recommendation: **High Fat, Low/Nonexistent Sugar, Low Carbs, More Veggies, More Protein, More Water and Less Frequency**(One Meal A Day, or Intermittent Fasting, or One and A Half Meal A Day)

## 8. Write something

So many people all over the globe attest to the importance and benefits of writing. Try starting a journal, if it's a bit hard try **Gratitude Journaling**. This can also be blogging like [**me **](https://ajulusthoughts.stephenajulu.com/authors/stephen-ajulu/)but keep a separate journal for private thoughts.

## 9. Get a job(and build a side hustle) or build a business

Simple, right? Get a high-paying job and make a side hustle or build a business. Money is everything in our world don't be fooled. Dream big. Put in the work and enjoy the results. **Make it a priority to build 6 income sources.**

## 10. Start investing + saving

Invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, real estate, people, and more. But first, build an emergency fund. **Tip: Build an emergency fund capable of carrying you(with your current lifestyle) for 6 months**. This acts as a cushion for cases like this pandemic. Many people were laid off and they didn't have an emergency fund. Get yourself a health insurance cover as well.
