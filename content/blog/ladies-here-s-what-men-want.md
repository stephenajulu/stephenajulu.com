1. Physical Attraction - He must feel physically attracted to you. And no I'm not suggesting you go for butt lifts and apply excessive makeup. Just do you, look good. If you are alone, show some skin. Do the old "picking up my scarf to show a bit of my ass" thing you used to do. Etcetera. 
2. Respect - Men naturally want to be respected especially by you. 
3. To feel wanted - Don't hesitate to show him how much you love and want him, even sexually. Give him the "thirst gaze" sometimes. Just don't be needy and clingy. There are plenty of ways you can do this without being a pain.
4. Loyalty - I know cheating hurts for you but it hurts way more for us. Just stay loyal. It's not asking too much. Stop entertaining the countless men who constantly text you. Keep things minimal with that male "best" friend. Avoid going out with men even if they are your friends. I'll tell you this for free, that male best friend you have, definitely wants to bang you. Without a doubt. So do almost every single male friend you have.
5. Support - Not monetary support unless he's having financial difficulties. I mean at the end of a stressful day kind of support. Let him find food is ready, no quarrels, house clean, you looking good(sexy) with a big smile on your face. Hug him and give him a kiss. Ask him how his day went. It's the little things that matter. Help him take his tie off and serve him.
6. Femininity - No man wants another "man" in his house unless he's gay so stop with this "what a man can do, a woman can do better" attitude. Sure there are things you can do better but be humble. Be humble and submissive. This doesn't make you less awesome, in fact being feminine and submissive is what will make him proud to have you. So don't shy away from housework or from being feminine. 

Sometimes all a man needs is the type of woman God wanted you to be: YOUR MAN'S SUPPORTER!
