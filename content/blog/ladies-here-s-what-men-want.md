description: Ladies, here's men want, it's surprisingly simple.

1. **Physical Attraction** - He must feel physically attracted to you. We first fall in love with what we see. And no I'm not suggesting you go for butt lifts and apply excessive makeup. Just do you, look good. If you are alone, show some skin. Do the old "picking up my scarf/handkerchief to show a bit of my ass" thing you used to do. LOSE WEIGHT! Unless he's into BBW. But seriously lose weight. Look, ladies, I understand but it's always better to improve than to make excuses. Can you say you are truly happy with that extra weight? If you are, fine but 9 times out of 10 you are not and you have been lying to yourself that it's okay to be fat. But no it isn't, being overweight predisposes you to so many health risks even childbirth complications. Every man I know wants a healthy wife with whom he can live a long life and healthy kids who he can see grow up and get kids of their own. I'm not body shaming you. Lose weight don't make excuses. Just look good. You don't need a fat ass to get a guy. Stay clean, look healthy, I hear there are exercises that give you hips and add some junk in the trunk? Try them. I mean why not? You'll feel good, he'll feel good, everyone wins right?
2. **Respect** - Men naturally want to be respected especially by you.
3. **To feel wanted** - Don't hesitate to show him how much you love and want him, even sexually. Give him the "thirst gaze" sometimes. Just don't be needy and clingy. There are plenty of ways you can do this without being a pain/insufferable brat.
4. **Loyalty** - I know cheating hurts for you but it hurts way more for us. Simply because we invest more into relationships. When we commit, we commit for real. Just stay loyal. It's not asking too much. Stop entertaining the countless men who constantly text you. Just like someone, I used to know liked to say, "Curve them niggars". Keep things minimal with that male "best" friend. Avoid going out with men even if they are your friends. I'll tell you this for free, that male best friend you have, definitely wants to bang you. Without a doubt. So does almost every single male friend you have.
5. **Support** - Not necessarily monetary support unless he's having financial difficulties. But you know, emotional, spiritual(Pray for him), and mental support. I mean at the end of a stressful day kind of support. Let him find food is ready, no quarrels, house clean, you looking good(sexy) with a big smile on your face. Hug him and give him a kiss. Ask him how his day went. It's the little things that matter. Help him take his tie and socks off and serve him. Then "serve" him some more, if you know what I mean. Don't be another challenge he has to conquer. Don't be naggy. If there's an issue, find an appropriate time, sit down with him and air it out like the civil adults you are. Don't raise your voice. If he's in a bad mood, schedule it for another time. Unless it's urgent.
6. **Femininity** - No man wants another "man" in his house unless he's gay so stop with this "what a man can do, a woman can do better" attitude. Sure there are things you can do better but be humble about it. Be humble and submissive. This doesn't make you less awesome, in fact being feminine and submissive is what will make him proud to have you. It's a HUGE turn-on. Men love to be dominant. It's the testosterone coursing through our veins. So don't shy away from housework or from being feminine.

### Sometimes all a man needs is for you to be the type of woman God created you to be in the first place: A HELPER & SUPPORTER!

It can be challenging being a man. We constantly have to fight demons that you aren't even aware of. Don't spend his money unnecessarily. Don't nag. Don't cheat. Be his helper and cheerleader.

And no, most men don't care about your degree or how much money you make unless you make more than him or he's broke or wants to use you. Eventually, if you don't learn this from me you'll learn it the hard way that most men don't really care about your money, degrees, and other things such as having your own house.

### They just want a beautiful, attractive, and feminine woman who can cook, clean, support, and have good sex with. That's really it and sometimes that's enough to keep a man happy.

#### A happy man is a faithful and committed man!

Strive to be that good woman he deeply wants. Also about that cookie jar, please ration it. Don't just carelessly give it to everyone who comes your way. There's something that happens to things not made of pure hard muscle, they expand, wear and tear!

Final note: There are some great men out there. You just have to rethink what you want and change your focus. Don't stay with an abusive man unless of course, you like the abuse(You BDSM loving ladies, you!)

And kindly tell me your thoughts down below in the comments!

If you feel insulted or triggered, I'd also like to hear from you too. Why are you triggered? What can remedy that? Are you sure you are speaking honestly?

Remember the same way, women judge men based on height, fitness, and financial status, we judge you based on weight, problematic scale, and beauty. I'll just throw the word "double standards" here.

Have a great day ladies!
