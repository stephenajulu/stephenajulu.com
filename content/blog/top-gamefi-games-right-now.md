For players looking to get involved in these blockchain-based games and start earning cryptocurrency and NFTs, here is a breakdown of some of the leading[ games](https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/games) currently available.

### Alien Worlds

In this game, players join an alien universe consisting of several planets where they must fight for scarce resources and mine the game’s native cryptocurrency, trillium (TLM). Players can also battle each other, go on quests and earn additional income by renting out their land to others.

[Alien Worlds](https://alienworlds.io/) was the first game to [break through 100,000 users](https://www.coindesk.com/inside-alien-worlds-the-biggest-game-in-the-metaverse) and currently boasts over 2.5 million players. This was, in part, due to its free-to-play nature and the fact its metaverse world spans multiple blockchains including WAX, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain.

* **Native crypto token:** [trilium (TLM)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/alien-worlds/)
* **Blockchains:** Native WAX blockchain, but also runs off Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

### CryptoBlades

[CryptoBlades](https://www.cryptoblades.io/) is a web-based role-playing game that emulates traditional games like Skyrim or Dark Souls. Players can battle monsters or complete in-game raids to earn SKILL tokens. To help with battles, players can craft weapons to build an advantage over their opponents or boost their power. These items can then be traded in an open marketplace.

The gameplay itself is straightforward. There are four main components – fire, earth, lightning, and water – allocated to each character, weapon, attribute, and enemy. Each component will have its strengths and weaknesses, which players must then utilize and build strategies to beat their opponents.

* **Blockchain:** Binance Smart Chain
* **Monthly user base:** [510,000](https://dappradar.com/binance-smart-chain/games/cryptoblades-1)

### Axie Infinity

A Pokemon-inspired universe where you can buy, take care of, breed, and trade digital monsters called [“Axies](https://axieinfinity.com/).” Axie Infinity runs off its own specifically built sidechain so that it can optimize gameplay and scale effectively.

[Upland](https://www.upland.me/) is an NFT metaverse made to parallel our world where players can buy, sell and trade properties linked to real-world addresses. Users can then play, run businesses and connect with other Uplanders across the world.

Players have an Upland avatar that can roam throughout a city to look for available properties for purchase. Or they can visit other players’ properties. To earn special UPX rewards and increase a property’s earnings, users can complete a Collection.

Each card is represented by an NFT and is tradable or can be exchanged on the open market. The game relies on one-on-one fighting where players are randomly assigned battle parameters.

Both players then have a limited amount of time to build a deck of cards they will use to fight each other.
