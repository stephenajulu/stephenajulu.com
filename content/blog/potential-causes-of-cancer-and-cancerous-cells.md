Today, I'll cover some potential cancer causes that you should avoid or limit. My aim is to provide in-depth and credible information that could help you prevent, lessen or cure cancer if these products are eradicated. I suggest you go through the sites linked below and not base your decisions on excerpts that could be taken out of context. Feel free to open them in a new tab as you read.

## 1. Vegetable/Seed Oils

We already know that seed oils especially canola, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, rapeseed, soybean, and similar are unstable. They go through a long process; the end result is what most people use for cooking.

Here's an excerpt from the [National Library of Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28925728/) on the reason why seed oils could possibly be a cause of cancer:

> Repeated heating of vegetable oils at high temperatures during cooking is a very common cooking practice. Repeatedly heated cooking oils (RCO) can generate varieties of compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), some of which have been reported as carcinogenic. RCO is one of the commonly consumed cooking and frying medium. These RCO consumption and inhalation of cooking fumes can pose a serious health hazard. Taking into account exploratory study, the present review aims to provide the consumption of RCO and its fumes cause the high incidence of genotoxic, mutagenic, tumorogenic and various cancers. The information on RCO and its fumes were collected through a library database and electronic search (ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar). Remarkable studies demonstrated that the health adverse effects of RCO and its cooking fumes have been often attributed to their detrimental properties and ease to genotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic activities. RCO and its cooking fumes were found to enhance the incidence of aberrant cells, including breaks, fragments, exchanges and multiple chromosomal damages and micronuclei in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the large consumption of RCO has been associated with a number of malignancies, including lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. The present review provides additional insights into the polluting features of PAHs produced various cancers via cooking activities in indoor environments.

Seed oils have also been shown to increase cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Another excerpt from Jeff Nobbs

> Meanwhile, as vegetable oil consumption has grown, rates of obesity, cancer, and diabetes–among other chronic illnesses–have surged to [unprecedented levels](https://www.jeffnobbs.com/posts/what-kills-us-should-drive-us). Six in ten adults in the US have a chronic disease and four in ten adults have two or more \[[2](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm)\].

I'd suggest you switch to Butter, Ghee, Lard, Avocado, and/or Olive oil.

One thing I can say about this is, heart disease, cancer, and high blood pressure among other chronic illnesses have been on the rise despite the removal of saturated fats which were initially blamed as the root cause. 

More and more people have high cholesterol despite most(all) vegetable oils being labeled as heart-friendly with zero cholesterol.

Now, I'd like to bring to your attention a scheme in the 1950s where tobacco companies paid medical associations and scientists to cover up the fact that tobacco use caused cancer. My belief is that the same thing is happening now with big food and medical associations. Wheat is being peddled despite the fact that gluten causes inflammation and is one of the causes of cancer. We'll get to that in a minute.

I leave you to make the decision.

## 2. Processed Meat

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is “[**convincing evidence”**](https://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/) that processed meat causes cancer. Classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, it is connected specifically to colorectal and stomach cancer.

Examples of processed meats that have carcinogenic properties include: Frankfurter hotdogs, ham, sausages, corned beef, beef jerky and canned or lunch meat.
