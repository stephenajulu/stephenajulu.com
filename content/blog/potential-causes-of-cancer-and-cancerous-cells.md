description: Here are some potential causes of cancer backed with excerpts from legitimate
  websites and research papers.

---
Today, I'll cover some potential cancer causes that you should avoid or limit. My aim is to provide in-depth and credible information that could help you prevent, lessen or cure cancer if these products are eradicated. I suggest you go through the sites linked below and not base your decisions on excerpts that could be taken out of context. Feel free to open them in a new tab as you read.

## 1. Vegetable/Seed Oils

We already know that seed oils especially canola, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, rapeseed, soybean, and similar are unstable. They go through a long process; the end result is what most people use for cooking.

Here's an excerpt from the [National Library of Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28925728/) on the reason why seed oils could possibly be a cause of cancer:

> Repeated heating of vegetable oils at high temperatures during cooking is a very common cooking practice. Repeatedly heated cooking oils (RCO) can generate varieties of compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), some of which have been reported as carcinogenic. RCO is one of the commonly consumed cooking and frying medium. These RCO consumption and inhalation of cooking fumes can pose a serious health hazard. Taking into account exploratory study, the present review aims to provide the consumption of RCO and its fumes cause the high incidence of genotoxic, mutagenic, tumorogenic and various cancers. The information on RCO and its fumes were collected through a library database and electronic search (ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar). Remarkable studies demonstrated that the health adverse effects of RCO and its cooking fumes have been often attributed to their detrimental properties and ease to genotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic activities. RCO and its cooking fumes were found to enhance the incidence of aberrant cells, including breaks, fragments, exchanges and multiple chromosomal damages and micronuclei in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the large consumption of RCO has been associated with a number of malignancies, including lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. The present review provides additional insights into the polluting features of PAHs produced various cancers via cooking activities in indoor environments.

Seed oils have also been shown to increase cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Another excerpt from Jeff Nobbs

> Meanwhile, as vegetable oil consumption has grown, rates of obesity, cancer, and diabetes–among other chronic illnesses–have surged to [unprecedented levels](https://www.jeffnobbs.com/posts/what-kills-us-should-drive-us). Six in ten adults in the US have a chronic disease and four in ten adults have two or more \[[2](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/index.htm)\].

Excerpt from [Kesser Institute](https://kresserinstitute.com/what-really-causes-oxidative-damage/)

> Our cell membranes are composed mainly of delicate fatty acids, the composition of which is directly influenced by the types of fats we eat. The consumption of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids has beneficial effects on cell membrane structure and function. **Conversely, the consumption of rancid dietary fats compromises cell membrane health and promotes oxidative damage.** The primary sources of rancid fats in the Standard American Diet are industrial vegetable oils.
>
> Industrial vegetable oils, including canola, soybean, peanut, and safflower oils, are high in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Omega-6 PUFAs are delicate and quite susceptible to damage from factors such as heat and light. **Unfortunately, the very process by which industrial vegetable oils are made exposes omega-6 PUFAs to heat, metals, and other chemicals; this process oxidatively damages the fatty acids and produces “rancid” fats.** However, the damage doesn’t stop there; vegetable oils are further oxidized when they are heated during the cooking process.
>
> The oxidation of unsaturated fats in industrial vegetable oils produces advanced lipid oxidation end products (ALEs), which pose a significant risk to human health. **ALEs are absorbed from the gut into the circulatory system, where they activate an inflammatory response that generates cytotoxic and genotoxic compounds. They are also incorporated into cell membranes, where they increase membrane permeability and impair cell function.** ([**5**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17854006))
>
> To make matters worse, ALEs also co-oxidize vitamins A, C, and E, depleting the body’s antioxidant stores. **The combination of inflammation and antioxidant depletion caused by the consumption of industrial vegetable oils propagates a chain reaction of oxidative damage in the body.**
>
> However, omega-6 in and of itself may not be the problem; it’s the way omega-6 fatty acids are handled during processing and cooking that cause them to become damaged and pro-inflammatory. We needn’t vilify all forms of omega-6 fatty acids. While it is best to avoid industrial vegetable oils entirely, fresh, whole foods high in omega-6, such as poultry, avocados, and nuts, can be part of a healthy diet. For more information on omega-6 fatty acids, see my previous blog post “[**An Update on Omega-6 PUFAs**](https://chriskresser.com/an-update-on-omega-6-pufas/).”

I'd suggest you switch to Butter, Ghee, Lard, Avocado, and/or Olive oil.

One thing I can say about this is, heart disease, cancer, and high blood pressure among other chronic illnesses have been on the rise despite the removal of saturated fats which were initially blamed as the root cause.

More and more people have high cholesterol despite most(all) vegetable oils being labeled as heart-friendly with zero cholesterol.

Now, I'd like to bring to your attention a scheme in the 1950s where tobacco companies paid medical associations and scientists to cover up the fact that tobacco use caused cancer. My belief is that the same thing is happening now with big food and medical associations. Wheat is being peddled despite the fact that gluten causes inflammation and is one of the causes of cancer. We'll get to that in a minute.

I leave you to make the decision.

## 2. Processed Meat

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is “[**convincing evidence”**](https://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/) that processed meat causes cancer. Classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, it is connected specifically to colorectal and stomach cancer.

Examples of processed meats that have carcinogenic properties include: Frankfurter hotdogs, ham, sausages, corned beef, beef jerky and canned or lunch meat.

## 3. Environmental Toxins

These are mainly toxins that are made in industries or natural occurring toxins or are byproducts of things made in industries.

Here's an excerpt from [Kesser Institute](https://kresserinstitute.com/what-really-causes-oxidative-damage/)

> The slew of [**environmental toxins**](https://kresserinstitute.com/environmental-toxins-drug-metabolism-microbiome/) to which we are exposed daily is a significant source of oxidative stress. A patient’s living environment can be a significant source of oxidative stress**. Exposure to particulate air pollution in urban areas and mold and biotoxins in water-damaged buildings promotes oxidative stress by depleting antioxidant reserves.** ([**11**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11869-010-0101-8), [**12**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3179161/)) You can learn more about the harmful health effects of mold and biotoxins by reading my article “[**5 Things You Should Know about Toxic Mold Illness**](https://chriskresser.com/5-things-you-should-know-about-toxic-mold-illness/).”
>
> Plastics are well known for their endocrine-disrupting effects. **However, research suggests that plastics also induce oxidative stress.** In the body’s attempts to detoxify BPA, a ubiquitous plastic chemical, free radicals are generated via activation of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. The induction of free radicals and oxidative stress by BPA is believed to contribute significantly to the toxicity and carcinogenicity of this compound. ([**13**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28181297))
>
> Pesticides and heavy metals also provoke oxidative stress. **Exposure to organophosphate insecticides (OPs), the residues of which can be found on conventionally grown fruits and vegetables, induces oxidative stress by activating cytochrome P450 enzymes and by disturbing the cell redox system, which reduces cellular energy and makes cells unable to neutralize free radicals.** ([**14**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048357510001355)) Heavy metals, found in dental amalgams, air and soil, and our water supply, induce oxidative stress by altering the activities of key antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-s-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. ([**15**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3087445/))

Here's an excerpt from [Scientific America](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-many-cancers-are-caused-by-the-environment/)

> The [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov/) has classified 54 compounds as known human carcinogens based on studies indicating they cause at least one type of cancer in people, according to the nation’s 11th Report on Carcinogens. The highest exposures occur in an occupational setting, but there are environmental exposures as well.
>
> For example, [benzene](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=even-at-low-levels-benzen), a known cause of human leukemia, is a common pollutant in vehicle exhaust. Radon, a natural radioactive gas found in many homes, raises the risk of lung cancer. [Arsenic](https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=dangerous-drinking-water-arsenics-t-2010-02-23), linked to skin, liver, bladder and lung cancer, contaminates some drinking water supplies. Other known human carcinogens include asbestos, hexavalent chromium, aflatoxins and vinyl chloride.

Now remember, some of these chemicals are in our cosmetics and grooming products. The skin is the largest organ so you can imagine the dangers of putting these things over the long term. I've already talk about endocrine & fertility disruptors found in grooming and cosmetic products, find that here: [Endocrine(Hormonal) Disruptors in Grooming Products and Cosmetics | Stephen Ajulu · Entreprenuer, Writer, Designer & Creator](https://stephenajulu.com/blog/endocrine-hormonal-disruptors-in-grooming-products-and-cosmetics/)

## 4. Obesity

Obesity is linked to 13 types of cancer, including two of the most common—breast and prostate—but only [a little more than half](http://www.aicr.org/assets/docs/pdf/education/aicr-awareness-report-2015.pdf) of Americans are aware that it’s a risk factor for cancer. In fact, physical inactivity and obesity together account for 25 percent to 30 percent of colorectal, breast, uterine, kidney and esophageal cancers, which are among the most common types. “Obesity has become so important in the field of oncology today that maintaining an appropriate weight is one of the most important ways you can protect yourself from cancer,” says Anthony Perre, MD, Chief of the Division of Outpatient Medicine at Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA).

To help avoid obesity-related cancers, experts recommend you lose excess weight through diet and exercise. Be careful not to lose it too fast otherwise you'll be releasing tons of toxins that were stored in the fat.

## 5. Ionizing radiation

Ionizing radiation is thought to cause about 1 percent of all cancers. It comes from cosmic rays that enter the Earth’s atmosphere, the radioactive gas radon—found naturally at low levels in soil—and from certain medical procedures, such as X-rays and radiation therapy. When cancer treatments increase your risk of developing another cancer later in life, the decision-making process often involves weighing the risks against the benefits, says Glynis Vashi, MD, Intake Physician and Chief of Medicine at our hospital near Chicago. “It takes years for a cancer to develop,” she says. “So you do what you have to do at the time, and then you take as many preventive steps as possible to improve the chance that you won’t develop another cancer in the future.”

## 6. Alcohol

[Research](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet) has found that the more alcohol someone drinks—especially regular use over time—the higher the risk of cancer. For example, people who have three-and-a-half drinks or more a day are two to three times more likely to develop head and neck cancer than those who don’t drink. Alcohol consumption also has been linked to liver, esophageal, colorectal and breast cancers.

Alcohol increases cancer risk by damaging cell DNA and proteins, as well as the body’s ability to break down nutrients, and by increasing estrogen levels. People who use both alcohol and tobacco have much higher risks of developing head and neck cancer than those who use alcohol or tobacco alone.

## 7. Tobacco

The most significant environmental risk factor for cancer is tobacco, whether they’re using products like cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff or vaping, or being exposed to secondhand smoke. In fact, tobacco accounts for [80 percent to 90 percent](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/basic_info/risk_factors.htm) of all cases of lung cancer, which is the [second most common cancer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/small-cell-lung-cancer/about/key-statistics.html) in both men and women.

To reduce your risk of lung cancer, avoid tobacco altogether—don’t start the habit, and if you have, quit as soon as possible, and steer clear of secondhand smoke.

## 8. Oxidative Stress

A condition that may occur when there are too many unstable molecules called free radicals in the body and not enough antioxidants to get rid of them. This can lead to cell and tissue damage. There are many factors that may lead to oxidative stress, including obesity, poor diet, smoking, drinking alcohol, taking certain medicines, and exposure to environmental factors such as radiation, toxins, air pollution, pesticides, and sunlight. Long-term oxidative stress may play a role in aging and the development of chronic inflammation, cancer, and other diseases.

Diets, especially high-fat or high-carbohydrate diets, have been shown to be associated with oxidative stress by elevating the levels of protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation products while reducing the antioxidant defense status \[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391153/#B1-foods-10-01854)\]. In obesity, chronic oxidative stress and associated inflammation are the underlying factors that cause insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease by disrupting signaling and metabolism \[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391153/#B4-foods-10-01854),[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391153/#B5-foods-10-01854)\]. Obesity-associated insulin resistance greatly increases oxidative stress and the risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease \[[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391153/#B6-foods-10-01854)\].

In general oxidative stress is the leading cause of cancer due to byproducts called free radicals. Most of the causes listed above cause oxidative stress which in turn cause free radicals. How do you avoid them?

## How Can We Prevent Oxidative Damage?

There are many dietary and lifestyle strategies we can implement with our patients to help them prevent oxidative damage.

**Avoid rancid vegetable oils.** You should steer clear of processed, packaged foods and toss out any canola, soybean, safflower, sunflower, peanut, or grapeseed oil you may have sitting in your pantries. When eating out at restaurants, where industrial vegetable oils saturate most foods, ask to have your vegetables cooked in butter and your salads dressed with olive oil. Eat anti-inflammatory fats found in extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, avocados, wild-caught seafood, butter, tallow and sprouted or lightly roasted nuts and seeds.

**Eat an antioxidant-rich, whole-foods diet.** This type of diet supplies the body with the antioxidants and cofactors it needs to combat oxidative stress.

**Stop smoking.**

[**Emphasize the importance of daily stress-reduction practices**](https://kresserinstitute.com/health-coaching-and-stress-management/)**.** Meditation, yoga, spending time in nature, and taking “technology breaks” alleviate chronic stress, which causes oxidative stress when allowed to continue unabated.

**Strategies to help you reduce your environmental toxin exposure.** Stop using pesticides on your lawns and gardens. Buy organic food as often as possible, avoid storing food in plastic containers and handling receipts, safely eliminate sources of heavy metal exposure such as dental amalgams, and filter drinking and bathing water.

**Emphasize the importance of circadian rhythms and sleep hygiene.** Aiming for a regular sleep schedule, avoiding blue light at night, and getting plenty of sunlight during the day helps to sync circadian rhythms.

**Treat infections.** Chronic infections are a significant cause of oxidative stress and must be addressed to halt the free radical cascade.

**Get regular exercise.** Aim for 30 or more minutes of exercise four to five days a week. Also engage in light, intermittent physical activity throughout the workday by alternating sitting with working at a standing desk or by taking time to go for a walk at lunch.

**Address iron overload.** Iron overload is a complex topic, and there are many ways to go about treating this condition. Briefly, curcumin and green tea are two options for attenuating iron overload-induced oxidative damage. ([**27**](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134156), [**28**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X17302127))

**Try** [**Intermittent Fasting**](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide)**,** [**OMAD**](https://www.healthline.com/health/one-meal-a-day) **or** [**2MAD**](https://2mealday.com/article/intermittent-fasting-omad-vs-2mad-which-is-better/). As shown above, frequent eating increases your chance of becoming obese which is then correlated with an increase in cancer.
