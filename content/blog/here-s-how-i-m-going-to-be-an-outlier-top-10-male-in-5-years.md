  male in 5 years

Hello guys, as the title says. Here's how I plan to become an outlier male.

There are different pillars of a man's life that need to be built up, these are:

1. **Health/Body**: Be in shape, healthy and active. Hormone, sleep, diet, and other optimizations
2. **Wealth/Money/Resources/Assets**: Have resources and money. Do life setup
3. **Relationships**: Be good to my family. Build a good circle of primarily male friends who have similar goals of reaching the top. Cutting out untrustworthy friends. Building a do-or-die brotherhood who help each other. Finding a good woman. Leading your family.
4. **Faith**: Get closer to God
5. **Mind**: Amass knowledge. Practice. Learn skills. Learn new languages. Fix mindset. Reading books.
6. **Style**: Dress better. Smell Better. Look freaking great.
7. **Others**: Body language, experience, game, stoicism, leadership, accountability, responsibility, frame control, emotional control, sexual interactions, looks maxing, personal branding, fighting, manly skills & more

So, to begin, I'll focus on 3 things. I won't do more than 3 things because then the transformation will exhaust me and I'll quit mid-way. I'll only do more when I have to.

My first focus will be on Health/Body, Mind & Faith/Spirituality. But along the way, I'll incorporate Others into the plan.

In the next post, I'll talk a bit about who an outlier male is and why we should strive to become like him.

In the next post after that, I'll cover my plans for health, mind, and faith, the foundational pillars.

Remember the goal is to become a truly top-tier man by the time 5 years a done.

For those who want to join in on this. By next week, I'll have set up a group where we can keep each other accountable and help each other.

Thank you and have a good one.
