I often talk about how important accessories are to your overall look and wardrobe. When done well, they add that extra 20% that pulls everything together and really lets your personality shine. I don’t recommend a ton of accessories but watches are one of the most important ones. It’s true that the watch you wear says a lot about you, whether you like it or not. Here is data collected from both men and women on why every man should wear a watch.

### 1. Watches Are Convenient

Phones don’t keep you punctual. Watches do.

A wristwatch is the most convenient way to tell the time.

_I don’t need a watch because I have a phone_, which is a common response from a generation who are now questioning the adverse effects of constant cellphone use. Fishing for a cell phone on regular occasions just to check the time looks desperate.

A quick glance towards your wrist is a much classier way to keep tabs on time during a date or a meeting. Not to mention how rude it would seem to your companions if you pulled out your phone during a conversation.

On other occasions where it’s advisable to leave the phone concealed – like the beach, a funeral, a wedding, a watch is a much more subtle and convenient way to check the time.

### 2. Watches Are Functional

Any item inspired by the military has a functional use. Wristwatches included.

Wristwatches were first used in the 19th century by the military to synchronize maneuvers during the war. Since then, specialized watches have been used in the depths of the ocean by divers and high up in the sky by aviators.

One of the big advantages of a watch – especially over a smartphone – is how long it can operate in the field. Many watches are made to either be self-powered through motion or use a small amount of energy from a battery. Think years of maintenance-free time telling…..compare that to a smartphone’s 8 hours!

A _complicated_ watch is designed with features beyond the basic function of displaying the time and date. Such functionality is called a _complication_. Two of the popular complications are the **chronograph**, which allows the watch to function as a stopwatch, and the **moon phase** complication, which displays the lunar phase.

### 3. Watches Provide Simplicity

The best watches don’t use the latest technology. They are powered by ingenious mechanical clockwork technology that predates electricity. So when your cellphone runs out of battery – you can trust the technology that keeps running on your wrist.

When you wear a watch – it’s less likely you will fall back on your phone as a distraction. Often, checking the phone for time results in a rabbit hole of activities including checking every messenger app, email, and Facebook.

When you need to keep track of something as important as time – a unique device to measure and manage it is justified.

### 4. Watches Signal Style

**_Compliments._**

The range of acceptable jewelry for a man is limited. Many men are only going to be seen with three main accessories decorating their hands – a nice watch, a stylish pair of cuff links, and a simple wedding band if they’re married.

In addition to helping wearers stick to their schedules, wristwatches make it easier for them to display their sense of style. They are a form of self-expression – reflecting a hint of danger, adventure, and sports depending on the make of the watch.

Watches can communicate a lot about the wearer’s personality. For those that prefer a bit of high-status bling on their wrist, a Rolex can be an understated, timeless, and incredibly masculine accessory.

As the saying goes – **_boys look at their smartphones to check time – men look at a watch._**

Call it what you will, a quality luxury watch is a man’s equivalent to the engagement ring.

### 5. Watches Embody Craftsmanship

A wristwatch is more than a time-keeper. It is a symbol of tradition and history encased in a showpiece with extreme craftsmanship.

Not many men realize that they are wearing pieces of art on their wrists. Some watch houses have four craftsmen working on one watch for several months – designing complex pieces of technology by hand.

**_It’s detailed art at the higher end of human ingenuity and creativity._**

An analog watch has a simple and consistent mechanism. The way of expressing it is where the bulk of the creativity comes in. Watch design is inherently artistic. There is a lot of generic and non-inspiring watch styles out there, but the best stuff is beautiful and how often do you call a tool beautiful?

Art on a watch can come in multiple forms. The dial can literally be a painting, or the design of the instrument itself is pure art. For many people – the movement arouses as much fascination as the dial and case.

### 6. Watches Make Great Heirlooms

Not only is a timepiece the quintessential gift – **it is the quintessential heirloom**. No matter what your philosophy is at the end of life, we can all agree that people can live on through the memories of those that knew them.

Owning timepieces from a different era is a remembrance of people who lived before you. Having their watches makes you think of them, in a real way. They wore these same watches which show signs of use, care, and love.

A watch collection is also a legacy. It doesn’t necessarily have to be worth a mini treasure – but leaving your watch(es) to someone you care about is in essence passing on values that were important to you, to someone else.

### 7. Watches Help You Create A Relationship With Time

Since the days of the sundial (and probably before) – men have been obsessed with devices that measure time. A reminder that our time is limited.

Wearing a watch has a positive effect on my attitude towards time. I am more attentive to how I spend my 24 hours.

Beyond the technical and mechanical intricacies of a watch, men are fascinated by these devices that claim to mark and control time.

There is a passionate community of watch lovers who dive into the details of watch-making and collecting.

The only other obsession matched with the passion for this inanimate object is the passion men share for cars. A watch collection is far easier to maintain and less expensive as a hobby.

Everyone can rock a watch. Wearing a watch is a great way to add interest to an outfit, especially if you’re a guy.

### 8. Shows Something About Your Lifestyle

Whether you’re wearing a [Timex](https://www.timex.com/), [Apple Watch](https://ashleyweston.com/mens-essentials-accessories/are-smartwatches-fashionable/), or a [Rolex](https://www.bobswatches.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI55nAwOqU5QIVl9hkCh0VlQoUEAAYASAAEgI0y_D_BwE), the watch you wear will give a woman a few clues as to what your lifestyle is like, and that’s important when we are getting to know you. Maybe you’re a sporty guy and you’re into a [G-Shock](https://www.gshock.com/). Or, you’re more of a tech guy and an [Apple watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/) is your vibe. Either way, it lets women know a bit about who you are.

### 9. Shows You Pay Attention To The Details

Like with all of your wardrobe, the details matter, and women notice the details. From the fit of your clothes to your haircut, each small component combines to form an important part of the whole. Watches are no different. The right watch and style choices on your wrist show you care about the right details.

### 10. Shows How Cultured You Are or Aren’t

Maybe you think watches are redundant since you have a phone, sure, we get that. But, going that extra step is going to add another layer to your style and show that you’re about more than just the absolute bare minimum, and that’s definitely really sexy. But, it’s important to consider what you’re wearing and when just like your shoe choice. You wouldn’t wear Jordans to a wedding so you should consider what watch choices you’re making too.

### 11. Indicates Where You Might Be In Life

No matter where you are on your journey, personal or style-wise, your watch choice is a big indicator of where you are and where you are going. Like we said before, women (well, the right women anyway) aren’t concerned with how fancy or expensive your watch is, but knowing where you’re at and where you’re going is important.
