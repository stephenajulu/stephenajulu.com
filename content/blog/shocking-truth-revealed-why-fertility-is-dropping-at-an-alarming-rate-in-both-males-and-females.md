## How and Why Fertility is Dropping At An Alarming Rate in Both Males and Females Amongst The Human Species

As human beings, we rely on our reproductive health to continue the legacy of our species. However, over the last few decades, there has been a worrying trend in the decline of fertility rates in both men and women. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this alarming phenomenon and what can be done to address it.

### Understanding Fertility

Before we delve into the reasons behind the decline in fertility rates, let's first understand what fertility is. Fertility refers to a person's ability to conceive a child. In women, fertility is determined by the ovaries, which produce and release eggs. In men, fertility is determined by the testes, which produce and release sperm.

Fertility rates are determined by the number of live births per woman of reproductive age (usually between 15-49 years of age). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a fertility rate of 2.1 is required to maintain a stable population.

### Declining Fertility Rates

Over the last few decades, there has been a significant decline in fertility rates in both men and women. In fact, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction Update, between 1973 and 2011, sperm counts in men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand declined by an alarming 52.4%.

Similarly, a study published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that the percentage of men with sperm concentrations below the threshold for subfertility or infertility increased from 12.4% to 16.9% between 1989 and 2005.

In women, the decline in fertility rates is equally alarming. According to a study published in the journal The Lancet, the global fertility rate fell from 2.37 live births per woman in 1990 to 1.70 live births per woman in 2017.

### Reasons Behind the Decline in Fertility Rates

There are several reasons behind the decline in fertility rates in both men and women. Let's explore some of these reasons in detail:

1. Environmental Factors: Environmental factors such as exposure to chemicals, toxins, and pollutants have been linked to a decline in fertility rates in both men and women. For example, exposure to pesticides, bisphenol A (BPA), and phthalates have been linked to a decline in sperm count and quality in men. Similarly, exposure to chemicals such as PCBs, DDT, and dioxins has been linked to a decline in female fertility. In addition, exposure to environmental pollutants has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage and birth defects.
2. Lifestyle Factors: Lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and stress have also been linked to a decline in fertility rates. For example, obesity has been linked to a decline in male fertility, while smoking and excessive alcohol consumption have been linked to a decline in both male and female fertility.
3. Age: Age is also a significant factor in the decline in fertility rates. As men and women age, their fertility declines. Women are born with a finite number of eggs, and as they age, the quality and quantity of their eggs decline, making it more challenging to conceive. Similarly, men's sperm quality and quantity decline with age, increasing the risk of genetic abnormalities in their offspring.
4. Medical Conditions: Medical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and male factor infertility have also been linked to a decline in fertility rates.
5. Low Testosterone: Are you aware that testosterone has been dipping by 1% every year since 1950. We are experiencing a population crisis, rampant deaths, 

### Addressing the Decline in Fertility Rates

There are several steps that can be taken to address the decline in fertility rates. Some of these steps include:

1. Addressing Environmental Factors: To address environmental factors, we need to reduce exposure to chemicals, toxins, and pollutants. This can be done by using organic products, reducing the use of pesticides, and avoiding plastic products that contain BPA and phthalates.
2. Adopting Healthy Lifestyles: Adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management can help improve fertility rates. For example, eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and avoiding processed foods can improve both male and female fertility.
3. Addressing Medical Conditions: Seeking medical help for conditions such as PCOS, endometriosis, and male factor infertility can help improve fertility rates.
4. Fertility Treatments: Fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI), and fertility drugs can help couples struggling with infertility conceive.

### Specific Potential Solutions

#### For Women:

 1. Maintain a healthy weight: Women who are overweight or underweight may experience irregular periods and have difficulty conceiving.
 2. Quit smoking: Smoking can damage reproductive organs and decrease fertility.
 3. Reduce alcohol intake: Excessive alcohol intake can lead to hormone imbalances and reduce fertility.
 4. Manage stress: High levels of stress can interfere with ovulation and menstrual cycles.
 5. Take prenatal vitamins: Prenatal vitamins containing folic acid can help prevent birth defects and improve fertility.
 6. Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can cause hormonal imbalances and decrease fertility.
 7. Address underlying medical conditions: Conditions such as PCOS, endometriosis, and thyroid disorders can affect fertility and should be treated.
 8. Avoid exposure to toxins: Exposure to chemicals, pesticides, and pollutants can affect fertility and harm the developing fetus.
 9. Consider acupuncture or other alternative therapies: Acupuncture and other alternative therapies have been shown to improve fertility in some women.
10. Consult with a fertility specialist: A fertility specialist can help diagnose and treat underlying fertility issues.

#### For Men:

 1. Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight or underweight can affect sperm count and quality.
 2. Quit smoking: Smoking can reduce sperm count and motility, and damage DNA.
 3. Reduce alcohol intake: Excessive alcohol intake can lower testosterone levels and decrease sperm production.
 4. Avoid exposure to toxins: Exposure to chemicals, pesticides, and pollutants can affect sperm count and quality.
 5. Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can lead to hormonal imbalances and affect sperm production.
 6. Manage stress: High levels of stress can lead to decreased testosterone levels and affect sperm production.
 7. Eat a nutrient-dense diet and/or take supplements: Supplements such as Zinc, Boron, Magnesium, Vitamin E, Iodine, Calcium, Vitamin D, and Selenium have been shown to improve sperm count and quality.
 8. Address underlying medical conditions: Medical conditions such as diabetes, varicocele, and infections can affect fertility and should be treated.
 9. Wear loose-fitting underwear: Tight underwear can increase scrotal temperature and affect sperm production.
10. Consult with a fertility specialist: A fertility specialist can help diagnose and treat underlying fertility issues in men.
11. Eat more meat and eggs: Testosterone is made from cholesterol. Up your cholesterol intake.
12. Cut out seed oils: Most vegetable oils are bad for your health
13. Get in the sun!
14. Lift weights or work out. Less cardio, more resistance training.
15. Quit porn

## Conclusion

The decline in fertility rates in both men and women is an alarming phenomenon that needs to be addressed. While there are several factors behind this decline, such as environmental factors, lifestyle factors, age, and medical conditions, there are steps that can be taken to address this issue.

By reducing exposure to chemicals and pollutants, adopting a healthy lifestyle, seeking medical help for underlying conditions, and using fertility treatments, couples struggling with infertility can improve their chances of conceiving. It is essential to address this issue as our reproductive health is vital for the continuation of our species.
