Hi there, twice in one row, yea! yea!

But this is different.

Here's a brief list of reasons introversion sucks

## You don't get to make a lot of friends

This is a big issue especially for me. I have always felt like I am missing out. Even I know the benefits that come with having friends. To keep it simple. You get to experience a wide variety of emotions and events that you would otherwise not experience. I personally have never gone to a club. There are things I think are mandatory for someone my age to experience even just once.

## Sitting alone can get boring

I know this is the whole forte of introverts. I personally rarely get bored, especially if left to my own devices(my imagination and laptop plus some extra room) but it can get boring sometimes where your creative juices are drained.

## It gets pretty lonely

I can't even begin to explain this to you. It's something I assure you every introvert experiences, especially those I have met.

It gets pretty lonely.

## It can drive you nuts

I'm joking, but am i ðŸ¤”

I think this is a pretty exhaustive list, won't you say.

I'm not complaining. It can be good to just be by yourself but sometimes you wish you were extroverted. I am an INTP/INFP(50% Feeling 50% Thinking) I experience these moments and I find myself wishing that I was more extroverted, that I had more friends but these thoughts will always exist. I love being by myself. It can be fun! but I also wish I could hang out with friends.

Those are my reasons why being an introvert sucks but can actually be a great thing!
