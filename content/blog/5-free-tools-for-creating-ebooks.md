Here are 5 free tools for creating ebooks:

* [**Google Docs**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjU__3C4OXyAhUFrxoKHbwsD-oQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fu%2F0%2F&usg=AOvVaw2GSg9qEkTUoGTBtb4uwDkC): to write it
* [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/join/fret-cheese-concierge)/[**Adobe Spark Post**](https://spark.adobe.com/sp/): to design an ebook cover for it
* [**Gumroad**](https://stephenajulu.gumroad.com/l/EEnXP): to host and sell it
* [**Grammarly**](https://app.grammarly.com/): to proofread and edit it
* [**Carrd**](https://try.carrd.co/fxxsbw29): to create a landing page for it
* [**Instagram**](https://instagram.com/stephenajulu)**/**[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/stephenajulu)**/**[**Facebook**](https://facebook.com/stephenajulu): to market it
* [**PayPal**](https://paypal.com)/[**Stripe**](https://stripe.com): to receive payment for it

It's that simple but of course, you'll need a topic, 15 pages minimum but you can go lower. You can export it as a PDF then drop it on Gumroad. 

Not sure of the process/requirements but you could also sell it on Amazon.

Once you create your ebook, feel free to leave a link in the bio and I'll make sure to post it here. But it must be related to the topics(Tech, Lifestyle, Self Improvement, Personal Finance) posted on this blog.
