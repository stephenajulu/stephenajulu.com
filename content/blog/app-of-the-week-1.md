Hi! Starting another series on "Android App of The Week". Here's this week's app.

## [**Abstruct**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hampusolsson.abstruct)

This is a wallpaper app, the best wallpaper app for abstract designs.

All wallpapers are designed by [**Hampus Olsson**](http://www.hampusolsson.com/), the designer responsible for most Oneplus(& AOSPA) Stock Wallpapers. It has more than 362 abstract wallpapers.

Personally, it's my favorite wallpaper app and the artist is still releasing more.

#### Pros

1. 362 High Quality 4K Wallpapers
2. Option to download to gallery
3. The artist is still making more
4. Minimal Interface
5. No ads even in the free version

#### Cons

1. No desktop version
2. No new wallpapers

I recommend buying the Pro, the pro wallpapers are awesome!

Don't forget to pass by
