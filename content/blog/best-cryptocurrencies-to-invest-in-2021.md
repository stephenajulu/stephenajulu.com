Hi everyone, so today, I'd like to talk about Crypto. In this post, I'll cover 5 cryptocurrencies that I think you should invest in if you are starting out.

## 1. Bitcoin(BTC)

## 2. Ethereum(ETH)

## 3. Dogecoin(DOGE)

## 4. TetherUS(USDT)

## 5. Ripple(XRP)

Go check them out, especially with Dogecoin. Implement the HODL technique. This drop and rise so don't be afraid and only invest money you don't mind losing.

To buy these I suggest you try Binance using this link, you'll get **5%:** [**Binance**](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=CL2JFAB6)

See you next time. Stay safe!
