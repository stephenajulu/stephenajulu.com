Hello, to begin I'd like to inform you that 90% of all diseases man experiences are man-made.

No, not in the way you think. They are man-made in that, man himself made them, e.g Diabetes, Cancer, Metabolic Syndrome, Lactose Intolerance, Allergies, Hypertension, Ulcers, Obesity, and many more. We made them when we decided to deviate away from our natural way of eating and living. We are currently looking at a 50% decline in fertility(both male and female) since 1960. That's a lot considering the small gap.

We have begun feeding ourselves toxic foreign materials that end up inflaming, restricting, and destroying our wonderful bodies. Not only are we eating the wrong things, but we are also eating the wrong way.

Today I'll tell you how to get your life and health back.

### Step 1: Remove MOST(99%) processed foods

To begin we must first deduct before adding. Remove most of your processed foods, foods that have been marketed, and foods that come in packaging.

Leave the ones that have 1, 2, or 3 ingredients max.

### Step 2: Remove EVERYTHING with either Sunflower, Soybean, Grape Seed, Canola, Rapeseed, or Sesame oil

These oils have been known to be extremely toxic to all living things, especially humans. They go rancid very quickly and even cause cancer because they become oxidized when heated.

**Replace all your vegetable oils except Extra Virgin Olive Oil with Butter, Tallow, Lard, or Ghee.**

### Step 3: Remove all processed meats

Processed meats have soy which is known to cause male infertility. Plus they also have vegetable oils and preservatives which disrupt your endocrine system, inadvertently affecting your fertility.

You can learn more about processed meats, soy, vegetable oils, and other endocrine disruptors here: [**Endocrine Disruptors: What They Are and How To Avoid Them**](https://stephenajulu.com/blog/endocrine-disruptors-what-they-are-how-to-avoid-them/)**.**

### Step 4: Use whole, unprocessed foods

These contain all your body needs to grow stronger and fight diseases.

### Step 5: Eat plenty of beef meat, lamb meat, goat meat, organ meats, wild fish meat, and poultry eggs

This will provide you with the vital amino acids that will repair your body and help it become stronger and more capable. If you eat fatty meat, it will also help provide the ready ingredients(**Amino Acids + Cholestrol**) used in hormonal synthesis.

### Step 6: Eat full-fat dairy products from pasture-raised/fed cattle

### Step 7: Use only traditional vegetable oils such as Extra Virgin Olive Oil

### Step 8: Eat fresh organic fruits and vegetables especially seasonal fruits and Lacto-fermented vegetables e.g. Saurkraut. Limit fruits.

### Step 9: Use filtered water for cooking and drinking

### Step 10: Use unrefined salt and a variety of organic herbs and spices

### Step 11: Make your own salad dressing using raw vinegar(Raw apple cider vinegar with mother), extra virgin oil, and/or natural honey

### Step 12: Use traditional sweeteners e.g honey in moderation

### Step 13: Use only unpasteurized wine or beer in strict moderation

### Step 14: Cook only in stainless steel, cast iron, or good quality ceramic pans

### Step 15: Use only natural, food-based supplements

Synthetic supplements made in the lab are not bio-available and hence are not absorbed.

### Step 16: Get plenty of sleep, exercise, and natural light(sun)

### Step 17: Think positive thoughts and practice forgiveness

### Step 18: Exercise and focus on COMPOUND LIFTS

### Step 19: Journal or write a diary

### Step 20: Prepare homemade stocks from bones of pastured cows, goats, and chicken

### Step 21: Use whole grains, legumes, and nuts. Avoid wheat and any other grain that contains gluten
