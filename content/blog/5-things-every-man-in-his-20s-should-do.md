Hi men! 

Here are 5 things you should do in order to set up your life for success and level up.

## 1. Workout and build your body

It goes without saying that self mastery is key to growth. 

So workout, build your body and be physically capable. This alone will separate you from 80% of the planet. Don't become comfortable being unfit and fat. 

Adopt a growth mindset. Yes, you might be fat now but as long as you put in consistent effort, i can assure you that by the end of a month, the gains you'll be seeing will shoot up your testosterone and confidence. 

Plus, you'll be better capable of attracting that girl you think is beyond your level. Think about it!

## 2. Chase success and fulfillment over women

Look, these girls aren't going anywhere. Plus a recent study found that they want the top 10% of men. So instead of chasing a girl who might dump you for that rich bad boy. Become one yourself. Grind and hustle. 

Build a set of marketable skills or better yet work on your own business. Build your dreams. You won't regret it. Plus girls will be all over you once you succeed. 

So work on yourself. Work on your dreams. 

Now, I'm not saying "Stop looking, stop dating". What I'm saying is let success be your primary goal. 

My advice is this. Write down 5 things that are most valuable to you. 

Here are mine, if you'd like an example. 

1. God
2. Family
3. Wealth and Health(myself)
4. Friends
5. Women

Most of these women are hypergamous. So stop chasing them all over the place and start working primarily on you. 

Chris Brown wasn't kidding, "These hoes ain't loyal". 

Advice: if you've got a girl and a kid, please do a DNA test. In a recent study, it was found that 9 out of 25 men are raising children that are not their own. To make this worse, most of these women knew the kid wasn't there's but because they needed a beta/simp who would provide, they lied. So before adding your name on the birth certificate, before marrying. If you have a kid with a girl. GET A DNA TEST! If you found out the kid isn't yours, i suggest you leave but that decision is up to you. 

And you better not forget to INVEST your money. I post articles for beginners on how to invest. There's cryptocurrencies, stocks, NFTs, ETFs, bonds, bills, real estate and more. Pick some, research and invest. Simple

## 3. Seek God

Now, the only reason this is no 3 is because, i didn't structure this list but men you need to seek God. You need spirituality. 

## 4. Create/join a tribe

Guys, no man is an island, no man stands alone. I have to admit that i am having issues with this, seeing that i am an introvert with social anxiety but i am doing my best. So should you. And hey don't just join any group. Join a tribe of Like Minded Individuals. Ask yourself this "Where do i see myself in the next 10/20 years?" then join a tribe of people with a similar answer or similar values or even better join a tribe of people who are already where you want to be.
