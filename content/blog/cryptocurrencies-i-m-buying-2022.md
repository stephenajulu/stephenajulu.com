Here are the cryptocurrencies I'm investing in this 2022. I believe these have potential.

 1. Bitcoin(BTC): As you know from a previous article, I hold some bitcoin. In 2022 I'll be buying more with the goal of reaching 3 BTC in my portfolio.
 2. Ethereum(ETH): Same as Bitcoin. The goal is to reach 10 ETH
 3. Solana(SOL): Named the Ethereum killer. Lots of interesting projects are being developed using its blockchain.
 4. Ripple(XRP)
 5. Stellar
 6. Decentraland(MANA)
 7. Enjin Coin(ENJ)
 8. The Sandbox(SAND)
 9. Star Atlas(ATLAS)
10. Metaverse Index Token(MVI): This is not really a cryptocurrency but definitely worth checking out. It contains all/most of the metaverse tokens.
11. Polkadot(DOT): Has potential
12. Chainlink
13. Polygon(MATIC): A must-buy for me. Amazing projects built and more coming.
14. Pancake Swap
15. Uniswap
16. Illuvium
17. Moonriver
18. Loopring
19. Cardano(ADA): I have some and want more
20. Veechain
21. Shiba Inu
22. Dogecoin
