Hi there, it's been a while. Today I'll be sharing the top gnome extensions that I've liked since switching to Linux, specifically Zorin 16 OS.

1. [Bluetooth Quick Connect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1401/bluetooth-quick-connect/): Allows connecting to paired devices from the gnome control panel.
2. [Clipboard Indicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/): Clipboard Manager extension for Gnome-Shell - Adds a clipboard indicator to the top panel, and caches clipboard history.
3. [Color Picker](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3396/color-picker/): Simple color picker for gnome-shell
4. [Hibernation Status Button](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/755/hibernate-status-button/): Adds a Hibernate button in the Status menu. Using the Alt modifier, you can also select Hybrid Sleep instead.
5. [Extension List](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3088/extension-list/): Simple gnome-shell extension manager in the top panel
6. [WinTile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1723/wintile-windows-10-window-tiling-for-gnome/): WinTile is a hotkey-driven window tiling system for GNOME that imitates the standard Win-Arrow keys of Windows 10, allowing you to maximize, maximize to sides or 1/4 sized to corner across a single or multiple monitors using just Super+Arrow.

Next, I'll talk about the metaverse.
