Vegetable oils especially those from seeds e.g Sunflower, Canola, Corn, Cotton, Soya Bean, and Rice are carcinogenic, contain free radicals, oxidize much faster, and are unstable. Keep off them and switch to these healthier alternatives.

If you prefer unsaturated fats stick with coconut oil and avocado oil. But saturated fats are also very important.

Remember the brain, hormones(testosterone), and cell membrane are composed of fats.
