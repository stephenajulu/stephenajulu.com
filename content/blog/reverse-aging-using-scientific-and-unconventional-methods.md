Hello there! Welcome.

In this article, I'll cover proven methods to "de-age" yourself by 1, 5, and even 10 years.

## 1. FASTING

Fasting is a big proponent in making your body heal itself. It's the reason you don't want to eat when you are sick as your body to heal itself through autophagy and limit exposure to the same things that got you sick in the first place. Fasting, especially extended fasting(2 to 5 days or more) has been shown to clean up the body and remove harmful substances. It has also been shown to increase human growth hormone and testosterone which are vital in making you feel and look younger.

You want to first limit your intake of calories by limiting your eating window. A good way to do this is to practice Intermittent Fasting(IF) which specifies that you fast for 18 hours and then eat within a 6-hour period. What this means is that you begin eating at 12 or 1 pm and then stop at 5 pm or 6 pm respectively. By doing so every day, your body gets into a fasted state hence boosting those growth hormones. 

A better way to do this is actually by eating only one meal a day sometimes commonly referred to as OMAD. This ensures that aside from your eating time, you are always in a fasted state. This style also follows the IF eating style by ensuring you can only start eating your meal between 1 pm and 6 pm. 

In my opinion, OMAD is the best. All you need to do is create a system where you make sure each meal is packed with nutrients especially proteins and fats(avocado, olive, naturally occurring, animal). Proteins will ensure you feel satieted throughout your day plus they will help build key compounds e.g collagen responsible for better skin. My number one recommendation for protein is animal protein, especially from grass-fed cows and free-range goats, chicken e.t.c. Take into account eggs as well.

You can also schedule a weekly or monthly fasting period where you fast from 32 hours all the way to 72 hours which will promote AutoPhagy.

## 2. DIET

Your diet will dictate how effective fasting will be. You need to ensure you are eating some version of the Paleo Diet with plenty of meat. Some of the things you can include in this that will boost the reverse aging process include bone broth, connective tissue, and eggs. These have high amounts of compounds that will ensure your body is getting enough of what it needs to heal and repair itself.

## 3. EXERCISE

Exercise has also been shown to boost human growth hormone especially compound lifts such as deadlifts, squats, bench presses, and pull-ups.

## 4. SLEEP

Getting anywhere between 5 to 8 hours of sleep is essential and beneficial. Before you bash me in the comments. Understand this, some people are wired differently where they can get 5 hours of sleep and still feel great. The key is to time just how much sleep you need by trying different patterns and then recording how you feel the next morning
