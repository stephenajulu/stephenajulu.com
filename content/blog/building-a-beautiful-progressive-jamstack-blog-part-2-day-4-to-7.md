Hey guys? Welcome to Part 2 of building the beautiful, fast, SEO optimized, progressive JAMstack blog.

If you didnâ€™t check out part 1, kindly go do so here: [**https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/building-a-beautiful-progressive-jamstack-blog-part-1/**](https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/building-a-beautiful-progressive-jamstack-blog-part-1/ "https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/building-a-beautiful-progressive-jamstack-blog-part-1/")

So we are continuing with Part 2.

Shall we begin?

## Day 4

Nothing much to do so i did a bit of research

## DAY 5

Hereâ€™s where the knowledge of Day 4 come to play.

* Linked the Manifest.json and all the app icons/favicons to the head section as you can remember i couldnâ€™t do this because i was using the original themeâ€™s layout folder so the only way was to copy their layout file to mine and that wasnâ€™t an ideal situation. So i found a solution, Netlifyâ€™s Snippet Injection tool.(oh thank you [**netlify**](https://netlify.com)) I had heard of this tool but it was back then when i was using [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrc.org)(another very good static site generator with thousands of themes), back then i only had 1 site deployed in netlify and i didnâ€™t need to tool. So to continue i managed to link them successfully and the website began acting like and app.
* Linked the Service Worker Register to the bottom of the body using the same Netlify Snippet Tool
* Added the SEO meta tags together with the manifest.json and app icons
* Added more Hugo Shortcodes and paired them with forestry snippets(since am using forestry as my CMS thereâ€™s no need to add the shortcodes manually just create a ___.snippet file in /.forestry/snippets/â€¦â€¦. as for shortcodes they go under /layouts/shortcodes/â€¦â€¦.. Iâ€™ll show you how to do this in just a bit.
* Researched
* **End of Day 5**

## DAY 6

* Added more hugo shortcodes and their respective forestry snippets
* Added a [**json feed**](https://blog.stephenajulu.com/feed.json) because â€¦â€¦â€¦.. why not?
* Added a [**custom 404**](https://blog.stephenajulu.com/404/) page replacing Netlifyâ€™s version
* Added a Comment system that uses Github Issues as the base, the comments system is called [**Utterances**](https://utteranc.es)
* Researched
* **End of Day 6**

## DAY 7

* Did a few tweaks and hacks
* Added Google Analytics
* Turned all images to .webp format because of itâ€™s compression and small file size therefore bringing the total homepage size to 432kb from 3.4mb
* Resized my author image from 1124Ã—1024 to 160Ã—60 or something there about(cant remember the correct sizes but they near those i have mentioned)
* Minified and Unified a few Javascript files
* Removed Google Analytics ðŸ¤£ It was slowing down my site because of the requests it made and also privacy issues
* Managed to make the PageSpeed Desktop Score 100 while Mobile is at 98 99(fluctuates)
* Increase page size from 432kb to 532kb(ðŸ¤£ by adding an important images that was 50 49kb each that were required for SEO)

Now to the good relationship i have discovered between hugo shortcodes and forestry snippets.

![github hugo shortcodes](https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screenshot_2020-04-05-stephenajulu-ajulusthoughts1-hugo-shortcodes.png?w=1012 "Hugo Shortcodes")

![github forestry snippets](https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screenshot_2020-04-05-stephenajulu-ajulusthoughts1-forestry-snippets.png?w=1012 "Forestry Snippet")

As you can see for every shortcode thereâ€™s a snippet, thatâ€™s because shortcodes usually have a small piece of code to embed in the page you want it to be activated.

![](/images/Annotation 2020-04-05 164626-1.jpg)

So the first piece of code goes to the /layouts/shortcodes/shortcodename.html while the last one goes to .forestry/snippets/snippetname.snippet. This ensures that i donâ€™t have to copy the last code everywhere manually, i just access them within forestry cmsâ€™s ui like this

{{< rawhtml >}}
<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-P0lVXehWM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

So now instead of copying the shortcode link everywhere you can just add it as a forestry cms snippet and use it where you would like. Note: This only works if you use Forestry CMS
