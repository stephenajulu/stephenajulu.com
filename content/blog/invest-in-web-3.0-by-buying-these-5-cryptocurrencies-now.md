---
The internet is slowly moving towards blockchain and has had an impact on investors who felt the power and freedom of the decentralized currency. Investors have made huge profits based on the DeFi protocol, and countries are trying to get on their hands on this emerging asset. Amid this is rising Web 3.0. It aims to bring to the internet what DeFi brought to the banking sector. Theoretically, Web 3.0 is the third version of the internet and aims to take back power from large tech companies. The Web 3.0 revolution will take place in the next couple of years, and the credit goes to blockchain technology. So, if you want to invest in the Web 3.0 era, why not headstart with these cryptocurrencies?

**Helium:** Helium is one of the most popular Web 3.0 cryptocurrencies and is responsible for making the internet accessible to everyone. This project offers a web service designed to compete with ISP giants like Verizon and AT&T.

**Polkadot**: If you are not new to the crypto market, then you have probably heard of Polkadot. It is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on the market and is a flagship project by the Web 3 Foundation, a Swiss company founded to facilitate a fully functional and user-friendly decentralized web.

**Kusama:** Investing in Kusama is almost a roundabout way of investing in Polkadot. It is because Kusama only exists as the companion of the Polkadot network. It has carried out many projects because the network is the benchmark for the success of parachains.

**Ocean:** Ocean protocol is a decentralized, blockchain-based data exchange. It functions as a protocol that allows anyone to build their own decentralized data marketplace. Ocean also functions as a utility token, which is used for buying, staking, and selling data for the governance of community funding on the platform.

**Filecoin:** As its name suggests, Filecoin is the file cabinet for Web 3.0. The network is decentralized storage that is created to be a safe alternative to centralized cloud storage and also a way to passively earn money. Filecoin wants its users to know that its storage is for anything and everything.
