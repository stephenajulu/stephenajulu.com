Hi there, here are 3 cryptocurrencies I believe you should invest in right now before the end of 2021

## Ethereum(ETH)

With the advent of **WEB 3.0** and **Ethereum 2.0**, Ethereum is set to become the most popular and most used cryptocurrency. Then there's the **Ethereum Naming Service**. Look just own 0.01 of ETH. Please do. Ethereum is that crypto that has so much potential. It can be used for so many things. Most metaverse tokens are built on Ethereum. Most Defi tokens are built on Ethereum. This should tell you something about the coin. So just make an effort to own this. Even just 0.01 ETH. That's enough.

## Bitcoin(BTC)

Bitcoin is the biggest crypto right now and it still has the potential to grow. Buy it now and forget about it.

## Metaverse Index Token(MVI)

The metaverse is hyped right now. I believe it's going to continue to grow. Buy this and you should be good.

Others to include that have potential: Dogecoin, Solana, Decentraland, Binance Coin, Uniswap, Binance USD, and Shiba Inu

NB: This article is not financial advice. Do your research. I recommend you start with Web 3.0, Metaverse, and Defi.

To finalize, if youâ€™d like to invest in the aforementioned cryptocurrencies then invest with Binance and get 5%: [**Buy and Trade Crypto With The Best Exchange: Binance**](https://www.jadeblack.co/?ref=kuzqn53jomp-)

Have a great day everyone!
