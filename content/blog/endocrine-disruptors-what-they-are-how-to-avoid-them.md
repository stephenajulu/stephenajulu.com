Types of Endocrine Disruptors

1. **Natural Hormones:**   
   Released into the environment from an animal and chemicals produced by one species that exert hormonal actions on other animals. For example, human hormones unintentionally reactivated during the processing of human waste in sewage effluent may result in changes to fish.
2. **Natural Chemicals:**  
   Includes toxins produced by components of plants (the so-called **phytoestrogens**, such as genistein or coumestrol) and certain fungi.
3. **Synthetically Produced Pharmaceuticals:**  
   These are intended to be highly hormonally active. Examples include the contraceptive pill and treatments for hormone-responsive cancers. These may also be detected in sewage effluent.
4. **Man-made Chemicals:**  
   and by-products released into the environment. Laboratory experiments have suggested that some man-made chemicals might be able to cause endocrine changes. These include some pesticides (including DDT and other chlorinated compounds), chemicals in some consumer and medical products (such as some plastic additives), and a number of industrial chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins).
