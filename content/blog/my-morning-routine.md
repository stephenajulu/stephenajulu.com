  4 month plan for self improvement

Hello!

Today I'd like to share my morning routine. I have been using it for 4 days now and feel absolutely fantastic.

## Waking up: 3:40 AM

I wake up at 3:40 am to give myself a headstart. Note, you don't have to wake up at the same time as me. I do it because I'm comfortable with it. Previously I would wake up at 5:30 am but have recently found myself waking up at that time and hence decided to stick with it.

The first thing(not always) I do after waking up is to, thank God for His protection and for giving me the ability to see the day. I don't do this at the exact same time sometimes I do it later in the routine. But i hope to be consistent. I just say a short prayer of thanks.

## Check my investment portfolios + unproductive social media checking: 3:40 AM - 4:00 AM

I own some cryptocurrencies and stocks. So I usually go to Binance, check how the portfolio is doing. I also do a bit of research into potential crypto investments.

Then I check my stocks. See the profit/loss margin.

After this, I do some social media scrolling. It's both productive and unproductive because I follow some great people who put out informational content but I also follow other people that post their lives. Which is not necessarily a bad thing but you know. It's not productive. It doesn't add anything to my life aside from knowing what they are up to. I also check YouTube. I have subscribed to some great channels and so I watch a video or 2.

## Make my bed: 4:00 AM - 4:10 AM

After a prayer of thanks, investment portfolio checking, and social media scrolling, I make my bed. This is a must. Don't just leave your bed disorganized as if an animal slept in it. Even Jordan Peterson said, "The most important thing you can do is make your bed!". Your bed is your environment and your environment directly affects your mind. Make your bed to get the ball going. You need good momentum.

## Workout: 4:10 AM - 5:10 AM

I have a bodyweight workout routine I follow.

Right now that is:

1. 100 Pushups (2 variations 60/40)
2. 200 Bicep Curls (An extra 100 for strength)
3. 100 Lateral Raises
4. 100 Squats (2 variations 50/50)
5. 100 Calve Raises
6. 100 Heel Side Touches (Targets the Obliques)
7. 100 Bicycle Crunches
8. 100 Leg Raises
9. 100 Bridges

Every week I increase this by 50 for progressive overload. I'll start doing advance variations once I reach 200, which means, I'll start from 50 again.

I'm currently in my second week.

What can I say, the biceps are growing well. So are the glutes!

The reason I do workouts first is that they are the hardest thing for me in the morning. Plus they give me energy and mental clarity for the day.

## Read a book: 5:10 AM - 6:10 AM

Once done with my workout, I read a book. Currently reading "How to Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill. I'll post notes on this book soon. I read for 1 hour.

I also drink 1 liter of water during this period.

## Official start: 6: 10 AM and Beyond

My day starts at 7:10 AM.

I will either take a shower(cold) or do some deep work/learning until 8:10 AM. It all depends on my schedule. I also write during this time e.g now.

And that's it. This is my current schedule. I will do my best and stay consistent as that's the only way to grow and become better. I'll soon add journaling to the reading time frame.
