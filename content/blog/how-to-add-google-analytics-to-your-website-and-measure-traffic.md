Hi, today I'd like to help you set up Google Analytics and monitor your traffic.

### What Does Google Analytics Do?

Google Analytics gathers a wide variety of information, which can be divided into five categories:

* **Realtime:** Displays what’s happening on your site at the specific moment you’re viewing the report.
* **Audience:** Includes information about who is visiting your site, including demographics.
* **Acquisition:** Explains how your site acquires traffic.
* **Behavior:** Shows what visitors do on your site, including buttons clicks and which of your pages are the most popular.
* **Conversions:** An advanced report to be used in conjunction with Google Analytics Goals, to track activity such as email list subscriptions or e-commerce sales.

Some examples of specific information you might find in your Google Analytics reports include:

* The number of active users on your site at any given moment.
* How many people visit your site over time.
* Your visitors’ ages, genders, and locations.
* Where your visitors come from (e.g., organic search, social media, etc.).
* Which pages visitors view and for how long.
* Bounce, click-through, and conversion rates.

### Why is Google Analytics Important for Your Website?

Once you’ve started a WordPress website, you should know how it’s performing. And to get this useful data, you need Google Analytics. It’s a powerful tool that helps you understand how people use your site.

Here are some benefits of using Analytics:

* **Identify Traffic Sources** – You can find out where your visitors come from, which channel they use (search, social, paid, etc.), which country they belong to, and more.
* **Better Understand Your Audience** – Once someone lands on your website, what do they do? With Google Analytics, you can track their every interaction and see what links they click or which files they download.
* **Create Content That People Like** – Google Analytics helps you track your pages and posts, so you know which content drives a lot of traffic. This way, you can find similar topics to cover and boost your traffic.
* **Conversions and Sales** – If you have an eCommerce store, then Google Analytics can help you track your conversions and see how much revenue your store is making.
* **Improve Your Site’s User Experience** – Find out how people behave on your site, which pages they visit, which device or browser they use so you can improve the user experience of your website.
