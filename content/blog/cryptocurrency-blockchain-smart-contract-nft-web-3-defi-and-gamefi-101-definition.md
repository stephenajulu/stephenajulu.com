### What is a cryptocurrency?

A **cryptocurrency** is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead, they use a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.

### What is blockchain?

A **blockchain** is a growing list of records, called _blocks_, that are linked together using [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"). Each block contains a [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function "Cryptographic hash function") of the previous block, a [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping "Trusted timestamping"), and transaction data (generally represented as a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree "Merkle tree")). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

### What is a smart contract?

A **smart contract** is a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") or a [transaction protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_Protocol_Data_Unit "Transaction Protocol Data Unit") that is intended to automatically execute, control, or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a [contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract "Contract") or an agreement. The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediates, arbitrations, and enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions.

### What is an NFT?

A **non-fungible token** (**NFT**) is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger "Ledger") ([blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain "Blockchain")). NFTs can be associated with reproducible digital files such as photos, videos, and audio. NFTs use a digital ledger to provide a public [certificate of authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_authenticity "Certificate of authenticity") or [proof of ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_(property) "Title (property)"), but it does not restrict the sharing or copying of the underlying digital file. The lack of interchangeability ([fungibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility "Fungibility")) distinguishes NFTs from blockchain [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrencies "Cryptocurrencies"), such as [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin").

### What is Web 3?

**Web3,** also known as **Web 3.0**, is an idea for a new iteration of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") that is based on public [blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain "Blockchain"). The term was coined in 2014 by [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum "Ethereum") co-founder [Gavin Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Wood "Gavin Wood"), and the idea gained interest in 2020 and 2021 from [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency") enthusiasts, large technology companies, and venture capitalist firms.

### What is DeFi?

**Decentralized finance** (commonly referred to as **DeFi**) is a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain "Blockchain")-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial [intermediaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediary "Intermediary") such as [brokerages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokerage "Brokerage"), [exchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_(organized_market) "Exchange (organized market)"), or [banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank "Bank") to offer traditional [financial instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument "Financial instrument"), and instead utilizes [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract "Smart contract") on blockchains, the most common being [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum "Ethereum").\[[_citation needed_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\] DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds from others, speculate on price movements on a range of assets using derivatives, trade [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrencies "Cryptocurrencies"), insure against risks, and earn [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest "Interest") in savings-like accounts. DeFi uses a layered architecture and highly composable building blocks.

### What is GameFi?

**GameFi** is also known as Game Finance, is the gamification of financial systems to create profit from playing play-to-earn crypto games.
