Hi guys, how are you doing?

To begin let me first define masculinity and what it's not according to me.

#### Masculinity

Masculinity is the lost art of being a strong, confident, intelligent, skillful, and manly character that is focused on the pursuit of an ultimate goal bigger than himself, women, and those around him.

Masculinity is not toxic, aggressive, and overly sexual. On the contrary, it's a man who is in constant pursuit of things far greater than himself. Constantly improving himself and those around him. A true high-value man who is solving problems and creating things for the benefit of himself and others.

A man is destined to be a protector and provider. He understands his roles and follows the ways of his ancestors. 

In this age of betas, white knights, simps, and soy boys, a masculine man sets himself apart by being a strong, charismatic, and useful member of society.

Never before has masculinity been this demonized. Toxic Feminism has made attacking men/masculinity its the sole purpose and they are everywhere! 

But I like a quote by [The Path To Manliness](https://twitter.com/PathToManliness).

#### "When the barbarians are at the gates, suddenly masculinity is no longer toxic."

### How to create your own masculine character and live up to it

To create one, we first must know the characteristics of one. Here are a few examples. Remember we are working towards becoming a truly high-value man, not faking it. Go against the grain. Pick some characteristics, give yourself a time frame or a deadline then put in the work.

* Physically, Emotionally and Mentally Strong
* Intelligent and Highly Skilled
* Calm, Collected, and Stoic
* Having the ability to exercise extreme violence but remaining virtuous - A controlled monster. The true meaning of morality, virtue and humility. [Definition first coined by Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ5oqgJWJyw). A harmless person is not a virtuous person. When a harmless person tastes power, they cease to be virtuous as they become drunk with it and begin showing their true colors.
* Self Control
* A Risk Taker
* Kind and Generous
* Playful and Charismatic
* Assertive and Dominant but not arrogant
* Independence
* Leadership
* Ambition
* Integrity
* Socialized
* Well Dressed and Groomed
* Respectful
* Dangerous
* Focused
* Sexual - At the appropriate time
* Mysterious

These are but a few examples. To create your own hyper-masculine character, I'd suggest you pick 5 then work on them.

Physical Strength and Virtue are a must. They ensure you are capable of protecting the things that are important to you without being a bully/brute. You don't want to be a brute who bullies people in an attempt to garner respect. You want to be a protector. One who is naturally respected.

Skillfulness ensures you are capable of providing for your family.

Make sure that whatever you pick leads you down a path that will guarantee you can provide and protect. As these 2 things are key.

I am on the journey of becoming a masculine and high-value man.
