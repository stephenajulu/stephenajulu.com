Testosterone has been dropping each year by 1% since 1950.

Men are becoming less manly, not only in behavior and appearance but also in their biological makeup.

In men, testosterone helps maintain and develop:

* Sexual features
* Muscle mass
* Adequate levels of red blood cells
* Bone density
* Sense of well-being
* Sexual and reproductive function
* Peak mental function(memory, problem-solving and critical thinking)

## Signs, Symptoms, and Effects of Low Testosterone

### Signs and Symptoms of Low Testosterone

* Low sex drive
* Erectile dysfunction(difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection)
* Decreased sense of well-being
* Depressed mood and suicidal thoughts
* Difficulties with concentration and memory
* Fatigue
* Moodiness and irritability
* Loss of muscular strength
* A decrease in hemoglobin and mild anemia
* A decrease in body hair and hair loss
* Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis)
* Increased body fat
* Breast development (gynecomastia)
* Infertility
* A decrease in critical thinking and problem-solving
* Docile behavior
* Smaller penis and testicles
* Sleep disturbances and even sleep apnea
* Low ambition and desire to succeed
* Weakness

## How To Increase Testosterone And Get Your Life Back

### Food

Avoid processed, prepackaged, and non-organic foods as they lack necessary micronutrients and often contain a plethora of harmful chemicals that severely inhibit testosterone production.

Instead, opt for healthier and organic foods i.e eggs, fish, fatty beef, cruciferous vegetables, pomegranate, shellfish, and oysters. Increase intake of Vitamin D(sun), Vitamin C, and Magnesium as these can help reverse the detrimental decrease of testosterone in men.

Also, note that testosterone production decreases significantly after eating. Hence constant snacking is bad for testosterone.

Obesity leads to low testosterone as fat cells metabolize testosterone into estrogen. Obese men also have low levels of SHGB(Sex Hormone Binding Globin) which is a compound responsible for transporting testosterone in the bloodstream.

### Sleep

Several studies continue to show that good regular sleep of 8 hours can increase testosterone production by almost 60% in men especially if done in routine(same times). Human Growth Hormone has also been shown to increase during good REM sleep which also helps boost testosterone. 

### Plastics(+microplastics found in food)

Plastics often contain xenoestrogens. Xenoestrogens are everywhere, they can be found in food coloring, furniture, industrial products, plastic tubing, clothing, and personal grooming products(more on this can be found here: [Endocrine(Hormonal) Disruptors in Grooming Products and Cosmetics](https://stephenajulu.com/blog/endocrine-hormonal-disruptors-in-grooming-products-and-cosmetics/)).

The list is endless. 

Xenoestrogens work by mimicking estrogen in the body of males similar to how your body is producing more estrogen than necessary. When more estrogen is produced and found in your body, your brain shuts down testosterone production and halts spermatogenesis(the art at which the male body creates sperms).

This not only decreases testosterone but also causes inflammation of the muscles and joints. These xenoestrogens together with the estrogen your body produces also cause you to gain fat further promoting the vicious cycle with no end.

The sad truth is estrogen is replacing testosterone in many men and the effects are dire!

But they don't have to.

You can choose to negate these effects by drinking out of metal and glass containers.

You can also avoid overly processed foods, plastic-wrapped foods, unhealthy soaps, unhealthy cooking oils(see more here: [Why I Advocate For Saturated Fats Over Vegetable Oils(Updated)](https://stephenajulu.com/blog/why-i-advocate-for-saturated-fats-over-vegetable-oils/)), and cosmetics.

As said previously, xenoestrogens are everywhere and can cause your libido to plummet, causes birth defects in children, and screws up your overall health.

A recent study showed that we consume the equivalent of one credit card worth of plastic every week! Shocking isn't it?

So if you can AVOID THEM!

### Exercise and Fitness

Men were made to hunt, gather, and be constantly active. 

Instead, lots of men can be seen spending time at a desk docile and then going home only to sit on a couch.

We were not created to eat, sleep, sit, and text. We were created for more.

On the bright side, exercise is not hard to start. It can simply be a walk and if you are like me, it can be lifting heavy shit or spending hours at the gym lifting weights.

Lifting weights has been shown to especially boost testosterone in men by almost 25%. 

Though too much cardio can have the opposite effect by actually reducing testosterone. Sprinting however is a good choice as this boosts testosterone.

### Sex and Pornography

Pornography and masturbation have been shown to decrease testosterone.

According to 2 studies, people who stopped masturbating for a week saw a 150% increase in testosterone. So, yea NOFAP works!

Frequent masturbation nulls/dulls androgen receptors in the brain responsible for helping your body use testosterone.

In fact, frequent masturbation enhances estrogen receptors, according to a different study. So keep your hands off yourself!

You'll love this: In a different study, normal sex between a male and a female has been shown to increase testosterone production in men. So keep it up.

Men are becoming weaker and are told being masculine is "toxic" when on the contrary men are supposed to lead, guide, protect and stand up for what is right. Sadly these men are now rare and hard to find. 

Men are nowadays encouraged to bend over to the government, to mandates, to bosses that make them do things that aren't right, aren't what they believe in, or don't want to do.

So stand up for yourself KING.

And if you feel you can't then maybe it's time you start following the things written above and look into ways you can increase your testosterone.

Have a nice one!
