Hi! How are you?

I like a quote Hafeez from The Roommates always says. Though i modified it so now it's my quote. It says,

> Improve yourself physically, spiritually, emotionally, mentally and financially, then go and change the world!

I won't waste your time and I'll get right into it.

### Physically

3. Start sprinting once a week
4. Eat real food: Veggies, Meat, and Eggs. Skip Refined, Minimize Starchy, and Eat Fibrous Carbs. Switch Canola/Sunflower Oil to Butter(Cow), Olive Oil, Avocado Oil, or Coconut Oil. Cholesterol is a building block for your body. This is especially true for men.
5. Sleep 7 + hours
6. Do OMAD(One Meal A Day) or OAAHMD(One And A Half Meals A Day)
