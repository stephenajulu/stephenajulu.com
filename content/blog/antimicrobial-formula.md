Here's an antimicrobial recipe that can boost your immunity/health and help you fight off harmful bacteria, viruses, and even fungus.

Requirements:

1. 15 cloves of garlic
2. 1 whole lemon(with skin and seeds)
3. 1 tbsp of turmeric
4. 1/4 cup of grated ginger
5. 1/4 cup of manuka honey
6. 20 ml of olive/coconut oil
7. 80ml of Apple Cider Vinegar
8. 1 cup of water

Blend these together for about 2 mins and put them in a jar. Refrigerate.

The longer it stays and ferments the better.
