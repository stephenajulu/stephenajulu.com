To become a man with resources you need to have at least 3 assets. Here are some:

## 1. Real Estate

Real estate is very important and I believe every man should desire to own this regardless, even owning one apartment is good enough.

## 2. High Value Skills

Having high value skills mean you can still feed your family even after you loose your job. Having High-value skills can hep you build a side hustle but they also show that you are intelligent and perfectly capable of taking care of your family in the long run. I want you to open a new tab, google "High Value Skills". Pick one and learn.

## 3. Investments

Investments are a great thing and one I suggest you start while you are young. 

## 4. Home

You need to have a decent home. It's mandatory. It's your territory. 

## 5. Connections

They say nowadays in Kenya, it's very hard to get a job without connections. And I think this applies everywhere. Have friends who know friends. Don't just make friends aimlessly. Make friends who bring something to the table. They say, "Show me your friends and I'll show you your future". And it's true because we simulate the people around us. This means having friends who know people can benefit you. But remember you have to bring something to the table.

## 6. A Fit Body

You see a fit body even in the animal kingdom means you can procure more resources and have good genes. It's wired into women. Yes there are other things that contribute but having a fit body is definitely a resource.

That's it for today. Comment your thoughts down below and I'll see you next time.
